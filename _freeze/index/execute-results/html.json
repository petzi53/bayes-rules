An Introduction to Applied Bayesian Modeling\" by Alicia A.\nJohnson, Miles Q. Ott and Mine Dogucu [@johnson2022].\n\n::: {.callout-note style=\"color: blue;\"}\n#### This is work in progress\n\nFinished about 23%. I am currently working in parallel on the exercises of the fifth chapter and started with chapter 6.\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-warning #wrn-000-personal-learning-material}\n###### This is my personal learning material \n\nThis text is neither an accurate replication nor an authoritative textbook.\n\nI am writing this book as a text for others to read because that forces\nme to become explicit and explain all my learning outcomes more\ncarefully. But keep in mind that this text is not written by an\nexpert but by a learner.\n\nText passages with content I am already familiar I have skipped. Section\nof the original text where I needed more in-depth knowledge I have\nelaborated and added my own comments resulted from my personal research.\n\nAgain: Be warned! In spite of replicating most of the content this Quarto book\nmay contain many mistakes. All the misapprehensions and errors are of\ncourse my own responsibility.\n:::\n\n## Content and Goals of this Book {.unnumbered}\n\n### Motivation\n\nIn the 1970s, during my sociology studies, I was trained in what I now know as frequentist statistics. Although I always felt somewhat uneasy about it, I only learned about Bayesian statistics—a different approach in probability theory—a few years ago. Despite having read several books on the subject, I must confess that I still don't have a firm grasp of it. I hope that by working intensively through \"Bayes' Rules!\" I will gain a better understanding of this approach.\n\nA remark in the preface supports my hope in this regard:\n\n> Bayes Rules! shows that the Bayesian approach is, in fact, accessible to students and self-learners with basic statistics knowledge, even if they are not adept at calculus derivations or coding up fancy algorithms from scratch. (XV)\n\nI ​have already read \"Bayes' Rules!\" once. It was a somewhat superficial read-through, but I realized that my difficulties began as early as the second chapter. Hence, this more elaborate, renewed attempt. I plan not only to follow all the steps in detail but also to complete and document the exercises.\n\n### Installation\n\nThere are several steps to get set up. Normally I wouldn't need all of them, because I have already worked on bayesian models. Even if I have on my system (macOS) most of the necessary packages installed, I need to install them again as I am using {**renv**}, a package to create **r**eproducible **env**ironments. I will write the complete list for readers of my notes down and select check boxes with entries I didn't need to install. \n\n#### Download Programs\n\n:::::{.my-resource}\n:::{.my-resource-header}\n:::::: {#lem-000-install-programs}\n: Download R and RStudio / Positron\n::::::\n:::\n::::{.my-resource-container}\n\nThe first step is to download the most recent versions of the following software:\n\n- [ ] R (<https://www.r-project.org/>)\n- [ ] RStudio (<https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/>) or Positron (<https://positron.posit.co/download.html>)\n    \n::::\n:::::\n\n\n\nEvery chapter of this books has a [session information](https://sessioninfo.r-lib.org/) where you can find details of my installation for the current chapter. There you will find the used packages with their version number but also information about my system configuration (such as the operating system, R version etc.).\n\nThere is one exception with this preface chapter: It shows all installed packages used for this book and not only the package needed for the preface. \n\n#### Install {**rstan**}\n\n\nOn of the most important packages for Bayesian Data Analysis is {**rstan**}. It is the R interface to [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/), a program that \"enables sophisticated statistical modeling using Bayesian inference, allowing for more accurate and interpretable results in complex data scenarios.\"\n\nThe installation process is pretty complex and I wonder that \"Bayes rules!\" didn't comment in detail the general procedure and all the things that can go wrong. In chapter 6, where {**rstan**} is used the first time is just says:\n\n> But first, load some packages that we’ll be utilizing throughout the remainder of this chapter (and book). Among these, rstan is quite unique, thus be sure to revisit the Preface for directions on installing this package. (p.128)\n\nBut in the preface there is just one sentence to direct the user to the original [https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started). \n\n::: {.callout-warning #wrn-000-rstan-version}\n\nI noticed today (2025-12-27) that the latest update of the web page was on June 3, 2024 referencing the Latest Development Version: 2.35.x (unreleased). This was later than the publication date of \"Bayes Rules!\" (2021-12-01) but still the text is already outdated as the several newer used version, the latest 2.36.0.9000 from Dec. 24, 2024. Furthermore believed that the recommendation of [RStan Getting Started Website](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started) could be problematic for two reasons:\n\n- It references [R-universe.dev](https://r-universe.dev/), a platform developed by [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/) to improve the publication and discovery of research software in R. On <https://stan-dev.r-universe.dev/builds> you will find not only the latest version of {**rstan**}, but also the current builds of other packages related with {**rstan**}. If you follow the suggestion of the book to get {**rstan**} via `r-universe.dev` but downloaded the other packages via CRAN, I am not sure if all the CRAN versions are compatible.\n- I believe that the latest build of {**rstan**} three days ago from 2025-12-24 (today, as I am writing this is December, 27 2025) is a source file that needs to compiled. Building from source requires more effort and technical expertise. It necessitates installing development tools such as compilers and build utilities. You can check if you are prepared to compile source file, by writing in the console `pkgbuild::check_build_tools()`. The answer should be \"Your system is ready to build packages!\". But even if all the tools are already installed, you would need to manage dependencies manually, and you are still not immune against potential compilation errors.\n\n:::\n\nMy suggestion is to try the latest compiled CRAN version 2.32.7 because I assume that the differences are either minor or cutting edge and therefore not necessary important for beginners of the Bayesian approach. Additionally is the book older as the [latest CRAN version](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rstan/index.html) of {**rstan**} from 2025-03-10. (Unfortunately there is no information which R and package versions the book uses. The GitHub link from the online book is broken and session information is also missing.)\n\n\n:::::{.my-resource}\n:::{.my-resource-header}\n:::::: {#lem-000-download-rstan}\n: Install {**rstan**}\n::::::\n:::\n::::{.my-resource-container}\n\n- [ ] Install the compiled {**rstan**} package from CRAN (2.32.7):\n\n<center>**Run this code chunk manually if the file(s) still needs to be downloaded.**</center>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# run the next line if you already have rstan installed\nremove.packages(c(\"StanHeaders\", \"rstan\"))\n\ninstall.packages(\"rstan\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::::\n:::::\n\n\nIf you get into troubles with installing reach out for help in an appropriate community forum. In the case of {**rstan**} you could use:\n\n- the official Stan Forum at <https://discourse.mc-stan.org> or \n- the RStan GitHub Issues page at <https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/issues>\n\nor more general communities:\n\n- Posit community at <https://forum.posit.co/>,\n- StackOverflow at <https://stackoverflow.com/>,\n- r/rstats subreddit on Reddit at <https://www.reddit.com/r/rstats/>\n\nAnyway there is no time constraint as you can follow the book until the sixth chapter where {**rstan**} is used for the first time.\n\n#### Install several other packages\n\nYou can install a set of data wrangling and Bayesian packages now or later when a `library()` directive wants to load the package.\n\n\n\n:::::{.my-r-code}\n:::{.my-r-code-header}\n:::::: {#cnj-000-install-packages}\n: Install R Packages\n::::::\n:::\n::::{.my-r-code-container}\n\n<center>**Run this code chunk manually if the file(s) still needs to be downloaded.**</center>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# run the next line if you already have rstan installed\n\nremove.packages(c(\"StanHeaders\", \"rstan\"))\ninstall.packages(\"rstan\")\n\ninstall.packages(\"rstan\", repos = c('https://stan-dev.r-universe.dev', getOption(\"repos\")))\n\ninstall.packages(\"pak\")\nlibrary(pak)\npak::pak(\"bbolker/glmmadmb\")\n\n# error with downloading rjag:\n## > configure: error: \"cannot find header file /usr/local/include/JAGS/Console.h.\n## > Please use pkg-config to locate the JAGS library.

Sometimes I\nhave them changed slightly to adapt it to the flow of my notes. But I\nhave not referenced the position of the (semi)quotes in the book. As I\nam generally follow the book's outline using the same text for headers,\nit should be clear where to find the quotes.\n\nThis means that most of the text in this Quarto book is not mine but\ncomes from different resources.\n\nMy personal comments should be clear because most of the times it is a\nreflection about the book and my experiences with it.\n\n### Repetitions as an educational device {#sec-000-repetitions}\n\nMy notes about the Bayes Rules! book are full of repetitions. For me as learner these repetitions are not redundancies per se, but serve as recapitulations to strengthen my understanding. In this sense these repetitions are educational vehicles.\n\nSometimes the repetitions are not mine. For instance the introductory part of chapter @sec-chap-002 is an intuitive approximation developed by the authors to get an holistic intuitive understanding which is developed more in details in the following sections.\n\nMost of *my* capitulations are provided in \"Note\" callouts. To understand better the different concepts and their relation to each other, I have added these callouts. These notes reflect my understanding at the time of this writing. It could therefore be the case that they contain some errors.\n\nAdditionally I have provided code listing where book figures or tables do not provide the underlying R code. (Unfortunately there is no (GitHub) access to the source code of the book.) My code does not always generate exactly the book output, but gives a general direction how to get the book results. For the generations of these code chunks I have used several times <a class='glossary' title='Large Language Models (LLMs) are advanced artificial intelligence systems trained on massive amounts of text data to understand, generate, and manipulate human language. LLMs function as statistical prediction machines, learning patterns in language by predicting the next word in a sequence. This allows them to perform diverse tasks such as answering questions, writing essays, translating languages, summarizing documents, generating code, and even engaging in conversation. (Brave-AI)'>LLMs</a>, especially [Anthropic’s](https://www.anthropic.com/) <a class='glossary' title='Claude Sonnet 4.5 is Anthropic’s most advanced model in the Sonnet series, released on September 29, 2025, and is now the default model for general use across Anthropic’s platforms, including claude.ai, mobile apps, and the API.'>Claude Sonnet 4.5</a> applied with the [Positron Assistant](https://positron.posit.co/assistant.html).\n\nBecause I have added many \"Note\" callouts, code chunks with tables and figures, my numbering is not identical with the book. Besides figures, tables, formulae my chapter section numbers conforms with the books numbering until level 3. To get a more detailed structure I might have added sub-titles of a deeper level.\n\n### Glossary\n\nI am using the {**glossary**} package to create links to glossary\nentries.\\]\n\n:::::: my-r-code\n:::: my-r-code-header\n::: {#cnj-load-glossary}\n: Load glossary\n:::\n::::\n\n::: my-r-code-container\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{#lst-preface-load-glossary .r .cell-code  lst-cap=\"Install and load the glossary package with the appropriate glossary.yml file\"}\n## 1. Install the glossary package:\n## https://debruine.github.io/glossary/\n\nlibrary(glossary)\n\n## If you want to use my glossary.yml file:\n\n## 1. fork my repo\n##    https://github.com/petzi53/glossary-pb\n\n## 2.

Store the file on your hard disk\n##    and change the following path accordingly\n\nglossary::glossary_path(\"../glossary-pb/glossary.yml\")\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n::::::\n\nIf you hover with your mouse over the double underlined links it opens\nan window with the appropriate glossary text. Try this example:\n<a class='glossary' title='A z-score (also called a standard score) gives you an idea of how far from the mean a data point is. But more technically it’s a measure of how many standard deviations below or above the population mean a raw score is. (StatisticsHowTo)'>Z-Score</a>.\n\n:::::: my-watch-out\n::: my-watch-out-header\nWATCH OUT! Glossary is my private learning vehicle\n:::\n\n:::: my-watch-out-container\n::: {layout=\"[10, 30]\" layout-valign=\"center\"}\n![](https://debruine.github.io/glossary/logo.png)\n\nI have added many of the glossary entries when I was working through\nother books either taking the text passage of these books I was reading\nor via an internet recherche from other resources. Sometimes I have\nadded the source of the glossary entry as an abbreviation or as an URL.\nMany definitions were provided by the KI provided within the search of\nmy [Brave browser](https://brave.com/).\n:::\n::::\n::::::\n\nIf you fork the XXX: \\[REPO OF THIS BOOK(URL OF THIS BOOK\\] then the\nglossary will not work out of the box. Load down the `glossary.yml` file\nfrom [my glossary-pb GitHub\nrepo](https://github.com/petzi53/glossary-pb/blob/master/glossary.yml),\nstore it on your hard disk and change the path in the code chunk\n@lst-preface-load-glossary accordingly.\n\nIn any case I am the only responsible person for the glossary text,\nespecially if I have used text from other resources wrongly. Again: The\nmain purpose of the glossary is to support my persponal learning\nventure.\n\n## R Code and Datasets\n\nDuring coding I am following the [Tidyverse Style\nGuide](https://style.tidyverse.org/). But for learning purposes I am\ntrying to prefix all functions with the package name in the format\n<package>::<function> (e.g., `dplyr::filter()`) This is an overhead but\nsupports me to understand which packages is responsible for which\naction.\n\nSometimes adding just the package name does not work. This is mostly the\ncase when a generic function name like `plot` is used by another package\nin a more specialized manner. In this case I will try to use the\nfunction of the package. If this doesn't work too then I have to come\nback to the standard usage of `base::library(<package-name>)`.\n\nI am using the package name also for the default installation of base R.\nThis wouldn't be necessary but it helps me to understand where the base\nR functions come from. What follows is a list of base R packages of the\nsystem library included into every installation and attached (opened) by\ndefault:\n\n-   {**base**}: The R Base Package\n-   {**datsets**}: The R Datasets Package\n-   {**graphics**}: The R Graphics Package\n-   {**grDevices**}: The R Graphics Devices and Support for Colours and\n    Fonts\n-   {**methods**}: Formal Methods and Classes\n-   {**stats**}: The R Stats Package\n-   {**utils**}: The R Utils Package\n\nI am not using always the exact code snippets for my replications\nbecause I am not only replicating the code to see how it works but also\nto change the values of parameters to observe their influences.\n\nWhen it is clear then I will follow the advice from Hadley Wickham:\n\n> When you call a function, you typically omit the names of data\n> arguments, because they are used so commonly. If you override the\n> default value of an argument, use the full name ([tidyverse style\n> guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html)).\n\n## Annex\n\nIn some of my book notes I provide files in the annex. They contain\nexperiments not directly in line with the book but inspired by my\nreading of the book.\n\nOften you will also find an annex file with a standardized short\ndescription of all my used packages, sometimes added with notes about my\npersonal experiences with this package. An example of the standardized\nformat gives you the following @sec-glossary-package.\n\n### Glossary package {#sec-glossary-package}\n\n:::::: my-num-packagebox\n::: my-num-packagebox-header\nPackage Profile: glossary\n:::\n\n:::: my-num-packagebox-container\n<center>{**glossary**}: [Glossaries for Markdown and Quarto\nDocuments](https://debruine.github.io/glossary/) [@glossary]</center>\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n::: {layout=\"[10, 30]\" layout-valign=\"center\"}\n![](include/logoi/logo-glossary-min.png){width=\"176\"}\n\nAdd glossaries to markdown and quarto documents by tagging individual\nwords. Definitions can be provided inline or in a separate file.\n<br/></br>\\\nThere is a lot of necessary jargon to learn reading new books. The goal\nof {**glossary**} is to provide a lightweight solution for making\nglossaries in educational materials written in quarto or R Markdown.\nThis package provides functions to link terms in text to their\ndefinitions in an external glossary file, as well as create a glossary\ntable of all linked terms at the end of a section.\n:::\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the meantime {**glossary**} is for me a very important learning\nvehicle. Whenever an expression appears with a doubled underlined link I\nknow that I will get more information by hovering the mouse over the\nunderlined text.\n\nThere is a little inconvenience with abrreviation that could also be\npart of another glossary entry text string (e.g.,\n<a class='glossary' title='An API, or application programming interface, is a set of defined rules that enable different applications to communicate with each other.

My\nworkaround is to end the short abbreviation with an additional 'x' and\nthen to call the glossary with the x-version follwed by the text that\nshould be appear in the document (e.g., *r glossary(\"APIx\", \"API\")*).\nThis double format is a standard feature of the {**glossary**} package\nso that you can adapt the appearing text to the glossary entry (e.g.,\nsingular/plural or other grammar changes).\n::::\n::::::\n\n## Resources\n\n:::::: my-resource\n:::: my-resource-header\n::: {#lem-index-book-resources}\n: Resources used for this Quarto book\n:::\n::::\n\n::: my-resource-container\nXXX: \\[ADD HERE USED ADDITIONAL SOURCES\\]\n:::\n::::::\n\n## Private Functions\n\nXXX: \\[DESCRIBE PRIVATE FUNCTION USED IN THIS BOOK\\]\n\n\n\n## Glossary Entries of this Chapter\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> term </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> definition </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> APIx </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> An API, or application programming interface, is a set of defined rules that enable different applications to communicate with each other.
