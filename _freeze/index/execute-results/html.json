An Introduction to Applied Bayesian Modeling by Alicia A.\nJohnson, Miles Q. Ott and Mine Dogucu [@johnson2022].\n\n::: {.callout-note style=\"color: blue;\"}\n#### This is work in progress\n\nI have just started. I am currently revising this preface, and I have also started the first chapter to see if everything works.\n:::\n\n::::: my-watch-out\n::: my-watch-out-header\nWATCH OUT: This is my personal learning material and is therefore\nneither an accurate replication nor an authoritative textbook.\n:::\n\n::: my-watch-out-container\nI am writing this book as a text for others to read because that forces\nme to become explicit and explain all my learning outcomes more\ncarefully. Please keep in mind that this text is not written by an\nexpert but by a learner.\n\nText passages with content I am already familiar I have skipped. Section\nof the original text where I needed more in-depth knowledge I have\nelaborated and added my own comments resulted from my personal research.\n\nBe warned! In spite of replicating most of the content this Quarto book\nmay contain many mistakes. All the misapprehensions and errors are of\ncourse my own responsibility.\n:::\n:::::\n\n## Content and Goals of this Book {.unnumbered}\n\n### Motivation\n\nIn the 1970s, during my sociology studies, I was trained in what I now know as frequentist statistics. Although I always felt somewhat uneasy about it, I only learned about Bayesian statistics—a different approach in probability theory—a few years ago. Despite having read several books on the subject, I must confess that I still don't have a firm grasp of it. I hope that by working intensively through \"Bayes' Rules!\" I will gain a better understanding of this approach.\n\nA remark in the preface supports my hope in this regard:\n\n> Bayes Rules! shows that the Bayesian approach is, in fact, accessible to students and self-learners with basic statistics knowledge, even if they are not adept at calculus derivations or coding up fancy algorithms from scratch. (XV)\n\nI ​have already read \"Bayes' Rules!\" once. It was a somewhat superficial read-through, but I realized that my difficulties began as early as the second chapter. Hence, this more elaborate, renewed attempt. I plan not only to follow all the steps in detail but also to complete and document the exercises.\n\n### Installation\n\nI took the following steps to get set up:\n\nXXX TO BE CONTINUED\n\n\n### Resources\n\nXXX LINKS TO THE RESOURCES MENTIONED IN THE PREFACE\n\n- Add DSLC resources\n- Add https://ajohns24.github.io/454_Fall_21/index.html (and compare the solutions)\n\nMaybe also of interest:\n\n- https://mathcenter.oxford.emory.edu/site/math117/probSetBayesTheorem/\n\n## Text passages\n\n### Quotes and personal comments\n\nMy text consists mostly of quotes from the XXX\\[BOOK NAME\\]. Sometimes I\nhave them changed slightly to adapt it to the flow of my notes. But I\nhave not referenced the position of the (semi)quotes in the book. As I\nam generally follow the book's outline using the same text for headers,\nit should be clear where to find the quotes.\n\nThis means that most of the text in this Quarto book is not mine but\ncomes from different resources.\n\nMy personal comments should be clear because most of the times it is a\nreflection about the book and my experiences with it.\n\n### Glossary\n\nI am using the {**glossary**} package to create links to glossary\nentries.\\]\n\n:::::: my-r-code\n:::: my-r-code-header\n::: {#cnj-load-glossary}\n: Load glossary\n:::\n::::\n\n::: my-r-code-container\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{#lst-preface-load-glossary .r .cell-code  lst-cap=\"Install and load the glossary package with the appropriate glossary.yml file\"}\n## 1. Install the glossary package:\n## https://debruine.github.io/glossary/\n\nlibrary(glossary)\n\n## If you want to use my glossary.yml file:\n\n## 1. fork my repo\n##    https://github.com/petzi53/glossary-pb\n\n## 2. Download the `glossary.yml` file from\n##    https://github.com/petzi53/glossary-pb/blob/master/glossary.yml)\n\n## 3. Store the file on your hard disk\n##    and change the following path accordingly\n\nglossary::glossary_path(\"../glossary-pb/glossary.yml\")\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n::::::\n\nIf you hover with your mouse over the double underlined links it opens\nan window with the appropriate glossary text. Try this example:\n<a class='glossary'>Z-Score<span class='def'>A z-score (also called a standard score) gives you an idea of how far from the mean a data point is. But more technically it’s a measure of how many standard deviations below or above the population mean a raw score is. (StatisticsHowTo)</span></a>.\n\n:::::: my-watch-out\n::: my-watch-out-header\nWATCH OUT! Glossary is my private learning vehicle\n:::\n\n:::: my-watch-out-container\n::: {layout=\"[10, 30]\" layout-valign=\"center\"}\n![](https://debruine.github.io/glossary/logo.png)\n\nI have added many of the glossary entries when I was working through\nother books either taking the text passage of these books I was reading\nor via an internet recherche from other resources. Sometimes I have\nadded the source of the glossary entry as an abbreviation or as an URL.\nMany definitions were provided by the KI provided within the search of\nmy [Brave browser](https://brave.com/).\n:::\n::::\n::::::\n\nIf you fork the XXX: \\[REPO OF THIS BOOK(URL OF THIS BOOK\\] then the\nglossary will not work out of the box. Load down the `glossary.yml` file\nfrom [my glossary-pb GitHub\nrepo](https://github.com/petzi53/glossary-pb/blob/master/glossary.yml),\nstore it on your hard disk and change the path in the code chunk\n@lst-preface-load-glossary accordingly.\n\nIn any case I am the only responsible person for the glossary text,\nespecially if I have used text from other resources wrongly. Again: The\nmain purpose of the glossary is to support my persponal learning\nventure.\n\n## R Code and Datasets\n\nDuring coding I am following the [Tidyverse Style\nGuide](https://style.tidyverse.org/). But for learning purposes I am\ntrying to prefix all functions with the package name in the format\n<package>::<function> (e.g., `dplyr::filter()`) This is an overhead but\nsupports me to understand which packages is responsible for which\naction.\n\nSometimes adding just the package name does not work. This is mostly the\ncase when a generic function name like `plot` is used by another package\nin a more specialized manner. In this case I will try to use the\nfunction of the package. If this doesn't work too then I have to come\nback to the standard usage of `base::library(<package-name>)`.\n\nI am using the package name also for the default installation of base R.\nThis wouldn't be necessary but it helps me to understand where the base\nR functions come from. What follows is a list of base R packages of the\nsystem library included into every installation and attached (opened) by\ndefault:\n\n-   {**base**}: The R Base Package\n-   {**datsets**}: The R Datasets Package\n-   {**graphics**}: The R Graphics Package\n-   {**grDevices**}: The R Graphics Devices and Support for Colours and\n    Fonts\n-   {**methods**}: Formal Methods and Classes\n-   {**stats**}: The R Stats Package\n-   {**utils**}: The R Utils Package\n\nI am not using always the exact code snippets for my replications\nbecause I am not only replicating the code to see how it works but also\nto change the values of parameters to observe their influences.\n\nWhen it is clear then I will follow the advice from Hadley Wickham:\n\n> When you call a function, you typically omit the names of data\n> arguments, because they are used so commonly. If you override the\n> default value of an argument, use the full name ([tidyverse style\n> guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html)).\n\n## Annex\n\nIn some of my book notes I provide files in the annex. They contain\nexperiments not directly in line with the book but inspired by my\nreading of the book.\n\nOften you will also find an annex file with a standardized short\ndescription of all my used packages, sometimes added with notes about my\npersonal experiences with this package. An example of the standardized\nformat gives you the following @sec-glossary-package.\n\n### Glossary package {#sec-glossary-package}\n\n:::::: my-num-packagebox\n::: my-num-packagebox-header\nPackage Profile: glossary\n:::\n\n:::: my-num-packagebox-container\n<center>{**glossary**}: [Glossaries for Markdown and Quarto\nDocuments](https://debruine.github.io/glossary/) [@glossary]</center>\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n::: {layout=\"[10, 30]\" layout-valign=\"center\"}\n![](img/logoi/logo-glossary-min.png){width=\"176\"}\n\nAdd glossaries to markdown and quarto documents by tagging individual\nwords. Definitions can be provided inline or in a separate file.\n<br/></br>\\\nThere is a lot of necessary jargon to learn reading new books. The goal\nof {**glossary**} is to provide a lightweight solution for making\nglossaries in educational materials written in quarto or R Markdown.\nThis package provides functions to link terms in text to their\ndefinitions in an external glossary file, as well as create a glossary\ntable of all linked terms at the end of a section.\n:::\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the meantime {**glossary**} is for me a very important learning\nvehicle. Whenever an expression appears with a doubled underlined link I\nknow that I will get more information by hovering the mouse over the\nunderlined text.\n\nThere is a little inconvenience with abrreviation that could also be\npart of another glossary entry text string (e.g.,\n<a class='glossary'>API<span class='def'>An API, or application programming interface, is a set of defined rules that enable different applications to communicate with each other. It acts as an intermediary layer that processes data transfers between systems, letting companies open their application data and functionality to external third-party developers, business partners, and internal departments within their companies. (IBM)</span></a> and <a class='glossary'>Capital Income<span class='def'>Capital income is defined as the sum of property income, including dividends, interest gains, reinvested earnings on foreign direct investment, investment income disbursements and land rents (Distributional National Accounts (DINA) for Austria, 2004-2016).</span></a>). My\nworkaround is to end the short abbreviation with an additional 'x' and\nthen to call the glossary with the x-version follwed by the text that\nshould be appear in the document (e.g., *r glossary(\"APIx\", \"API\")*).\nThis double format is a standard feature of the {**glossary**} package\nso that you can adapt the appearing text to the glossary entry (e.g.,\nsingular/plural or other grammar changes).\n::::\n::::::\n\n## Resources\n\n:::::: my-resource\n:::: my-resource-header\n::: {#lem-index-book-resources}\n: Resources used for this Quarto book\n:::\n::::\n\n::: my-resource-container\nXXX: \\[ADD HERE USED ADDITIONAL SOURCES\\]\n:::\n::::::\n\n## Private Functions\n\nXXX: \\[DESCRIBE PRIVATE FUNCTION USED IN THIS BOOK\\]\n\n## Glossary Entries of this Chapter\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> term </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> definition </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> APIx </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> An API, or application programming interface, is a set of defined rules that enable different applications to communicate with each other.
